<h2>Proposal</h2>

<h2>Our Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://coto.studio/">Coto Studio</a> is a Boston Based web hosting and design studio comprised of two Salvadoran-born brothers, <a href="https://nelsonroberto.com">Nelson/Roberto</a>, and Ernesto Coto, who were during the country&#8217;s civil war and reunited in 1997. United by their love of design, they founded Coto Studio at the start of 2022 after both of us were looking for a change in careers.</p>

<p>For Nelson, Coto Studio represents the formalization of the web design and hosting work that he has been doing on the side since 2015. Nelson has over 15 years of experience building, designing, and managing websites. He was worked with a wide range of web technologies and platforms, including <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, since version 2.0, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost Blog</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, among others.</p>

<p>For Ernesto, Coto Studio represents a career transition away from the silk screening embroidery business. He has over 20 years of design experience working in vector graphics, and graphic design for hundreds of clients and is excited to bring his design skills to help clients.</p>

<p>While our site company is new our experience is not. When it comes to designing sites our goal is to make them look as good as possible across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. This is actually more technically challenging than it sounds and we strive to pay close attention to layout, typography, and legibility.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<h3>What is your approach to designing websites for mission-driven organizations with small teams?</h3>

<p>After an initial discovery period where we work with our clients to identify their requirements, we create a prototype design to make sure we are in agreement with the look and layout of the new site. As we build out the site we share a preview version, where clients can view the work in progress and provide feedback along the way. We believe that feedback is a vital part of the process, especially when working with small teams because an organization&#8217;s online presence plays such a critical role in its marketing message.</p>

<h3>What tools and plug-ins would you recommend to help automate workflows and create a frictionless user experience?</h3>

<p>When it comes to building automated workflows we recommend <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. This service acts as a bridge that can connect many online sites and platforms. For example, Zapier could be used to add people who donate through Donately directly to the membership backend and even subscribe them to a newsletter. There are several other plugins and services that could be used to build a better user experience for the members of USLAF, which we would be happy to discuss in more detail.</p>

<p>As an alternative to WordPress, we recommend <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost Blog</a>, which is geared toward publishing but has membership and newsletter functionality built in and does not require the use of extensive third-party plugins. This not only makes Ghost easier to manage but also creates a smoother experience for members and subscribers.</p>

<h3>What experience do you have integrating best practices concerning accessibility for web content into web design projects?</h3>

<p>When working on a design we try, as much as possible, to include accessible features such as responsive text, light and dark color variants, landmark regions, and aria labels, which are important for screen readers and voice-over controls. We recognize that accessibility on the web is an ever-evolving field and we try to keep up with best practices like those laid out by organizations such as <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com">The A11Y Project</a>. Our primary goal when designing sites making them accessible by the widest range of devices and screen sizes possible.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Design &amp; Accessability</h3>

<p>Given a budget of 10,000, the approach we would take is to start by purchasing a theme from an online marketplace, and modifying it to fit the needs of USLAF. We recommend this approach because creating a completely custom design that integrates with WordPress is a complex and time-consuming endeavor and we feel the allotted budget for this project would be better spent in other ways. We are of course happy to discuss the option of designing a custom WordPress theme for this project but based on previous experience it is often more trouble than it is worth.</p>

<p>As for the design of the new site, we would like to focus on telling the story of USLAF, while highlighting the great work that its members are doing. This could be achieved by prominently showcasing their work throughout the site, perhaps even incorporating it into graphical elements, such as the navigation iconography. We would also like to work on creating a more responsive design, that would accommodate a wider range of devices and screen sizes. This would not only help address accessibility issues but also make USLAF&#8217;s mission easier to understand.</p>

<p>Coto.Studio would like to</p>

<p>With any mission-driven organization, it is important that the mission, and story of the organization is front and center.</p>

<p>As someone who is working on a documentary film and an autobiographical novel, Nelson/Roberto understands the importance ofâ€¦ clearly communicating</p>

<h3>Technical Recommendations</h3>

<p>When it comes to integrating WordPress with your donation platform, Donately, it is pretty easy to embed the donation form into one of the pages. Managing the members, however can be a little more challenging.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, when it comes to WordPress we recommend using as few plugins as possible. For this project, that might mean using services like <a href="https://memberful.com">Memberful</a> to handle USLAF memberships rather than a plugin like <a href="https://memberpress.com/">Memberpress</a>. While there is nothing inherently wrong with plugins, they add more complexity that can slow down the site and make it more susceptible to hacking.</p>

<p>When it comes to making the user experience more seamless, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> is a fantastic tool that can automate a lot of this worm. It can handle importing the contact information from people who donate on Donately, and bring them into WordPress, Memberful, or Ghost. It&#8217;s important to note that a lot of the technical decisions depend heavily on what services USLAF wishes to provide to its members. While we can make some recommendations here, a conversation would these recommendations a lot more concrete.</p>

<p>There are of a wide range of other technologies that could be used to do this project, such as keeping the site on Squarespace while improving it with design and integration enhancements. The technology decisions ultimately depend on two important questions, what is the experience USLAF wants to create for its members, and what services does it wish to provide.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<p>Our proposed timeline is to spend a few weeks on discovery, where Coto.Studio would work with USLAF to nail down all design, platform, and integration questions. We would then spend the fall, September through November migrating the existing content and working on the site design. From December to March we would focus on integration and automation, with the goal of finishing work by early March so that there would be time to test and check everything before the site&#8217;s launch. Given that the existing site is not terribly complex, it&#8217;s probable that the work could proceed faster than this proposed timeline.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>

<p>We believe there will be two challenges to completing this project on time. One is the platform and services integration. The other will be customizing the theme.</p>

<p>One of the biggest risks would be choosing the wrong technology stack. For example, we could start developing the site with WordPress only to find it won&#8217;t do everything we need it to. No technology is ever a perfect fit and always involves trade-offs. One of the best ways to minimize the risk of choosing the wrong technology stack is by having an adequate discovery period where we can make sure it meets the needs of the people who will use it the most.</p>

<h3>In Closing</h3>

<p>While Coto.Studio might not be as established as other vendors we do have the experience to tackle this project in a meaningful way. We would love the opportunity to discuss this projects with you further to see if we would be a good fit for what you are looking for.</p>

<h2>CRUFT</h2>

<p>Even though our company is new, we are no stranger to building websites or graphic design.</p>

<p>He is a skilled programmer who has built web applications&#8230;<br />
He has been hosting websites for paying clients, and managing servers for 10 years, and started Coto.Studio as a way to formalize many of his existing endveours.</p>

<p>Having worked primarily in the silk screening and embroidery business, he is using his skills as a designer onto the web.</p>

<p>Given a budget of 10,000 I would be able to move the site to WordPress. Setup integrations, and build a site by modifying an existing theme that could be purchased for less than $100 on any number of theme marketplaces.</p>

<p>is to purchase and modify an established theme from one of the many online marketplaces that sell WordPress themes, such as <a href="https://themeforest.net">ThemeForest</a>.</p>

<p>spent tweaking an existing design, rather than creating a unique design that then has to be integrated with WordPress.</p>

<p>I recommend purchasing and modifying an existing theme rather than building a new one from scratch. Creating a custom design and getting it to work with WordPress can take up words of 50+ hours, and I can say from personal experience it is often more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.</p>

<p>Themes, like most programs, need ongoing maintenance in order to work with the latest versions of WordPress. Also, in my personal opinion, WordPress is a difficult platform to design for, unlike newer frameworks like Hugo and Ghost. Good design is relatively &#8220;cheap&#8221; and for less than $100 one can usually find a theme that</p>

<p>Good design is relatively &#8220;cheap&#8221; and for less than $100 one can usually find a theme that</p>

<p>gets you 80% to 90% of the way to where you want to be. gets you 80% to 90% of the way to where you want to be.</p>

<p>The other reason I recommend purchasing a theme is that</p>

<p>I believe this is the way to go especially if you have other integration and automation needs.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the site that really depends on the goals of the Latinx Art Forum.</p>

<ul>
<li>What type of services do you offer members?</li>
<li>Do you need email/newsletter integration?</li>
</ul>

<p>From there modifying</p>

<p>and modification to be compatible with the changes that WordPress is making.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s much simpler to modify an existing theme and spend more time getting it set up the way you want. Also bought on marketplace places frequently come with additional support and upgrades.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also ask, what is the primary problem you are trying to solve? Is it a design problem, a cost problem, or a functionality problem? My guess is that it is a combination of all three but knowing where you want to focus will help prioritize the budget.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to minimize the risk of choosing the wrong platform is by taking the time to make sure that the potential technology meets most of the need of people who will use it the most.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to ensure that a given technology will be a good fit is to take the time to make sure it meets the needs of the people who will use it the most.</p>

<p>As a creative individual working on mission drive projects of my own, I understand the importance of leading with that mission and vision for the world as it could be. Drawing on my experience with marketing and storytelling I help organizations deliver a clear purpose through design and writing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve helped distill complex technical problems, such as building a crowd-funding campaign to fight patent trolls, to help build a website for a small business just getting off the ground.</p>

<p>There are many plug-ins available to help with automation. There are tools such as Zappier or ITTT, which can provide help automate much of the work.</p>

<p>It really depends on your needs and what kind of user experience you are trying to create. Tools such as Memebrful might also be helpful in managing your members. Again it depends on what you are trying to do with.</p>

<p>We are by no means experts in accessibility design but we stive to</p>

<p>I am by no means an expert when it comes to accessibility on the web, it is a topic that I have started learning more about. Concepts like contrast ratio, and font size are two areas that I pay a lot of attention to. I try, as best as I can, to make text legible with an decent contract ratio on all devices.</p>

<p>With newer sites, I have been working to include concepts such as linguistic HTML and aria, which is helpful to screen readers. I also try to incorporate light and dark variants of sites. Finally, I have also started to include link navigation in my designs to help with keyboard navigation. As I learn more about this topic I will be including more in my designs.</p>

<p>In general, I work hard to ensure that the websites I build look good and are compatible with a wide range of devices and industry standards.</p>
