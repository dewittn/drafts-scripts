# Opportunities to play over the summer

Hello Everyone,  
  
It's hard to believe, but the Ultimate season is already half over. With summer fast approaching, I wanted to send out information about opportunities to play Ultimate after the season ends. I realize that many of you already have summer plans and may be unable to take advantage of these programs, but I wanted you all to know they exist.   
  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!  
  
1) [The National Ultimate Training Camp](https://www.nutc.net/nutc25) or NUTC, a program designed for players between the ages of 14 and 18, focuses on the fundamentals of the game. It's one of the best Ultimate camps in the country, and some of the top players from around the country have attended and coached at it. It takes place at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA, and has three sessions from late June through July. You can watch their promo video [here](https://vimeo.com/317546824).  
  
2) The [Competitive Ultimate Training Camps](https://competitiveultimatetraining.com/) or CUT Camps are nationally renowned and take place in various locations across the country, with the [closest session this summer being in Chicago](https://competitiveultimatetraining.com/e/2025-cut-camp-chicago). This camp is more competitive than NUTC and would require a serious commitment.

  
3) [The Youth Championship Series](https://www.buda.org/youth-club) is a highly competitive travel team. Tryouts are on June 8 and 9. Even if you don't make the team, it's still a great experience to work and play with a different group of kids.  
  
4) For a less competitive alternative, the Boston Ultimate Disc Alliance, or [BUDA](https://www.buda.org/en_us), runs several high school leagues in Boston, Hopkinton, Lexington, and Newton. For a complete list of programs, check out [their website](https://www.buda.org/en_us/e/youth-ultimate-summer-2024).  
  
5) Finally, [there are several pickup games](https://www.buda.org/en_us/pickup) around the city for people of various ages and abilities. While most of those who attend these games are adults, they are open to all and are a great way to play some ultimate without committing to an entire league or camp.  
  
  The game I play at takes place in Newton at [1600 Washington Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1600+Washington+St,+West+Newton,+MA+02465/@42.3429363,-71.2355788,17.38z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e38255955746a1:0xdcb392991e94a981!8m2!3d42.3431423!4d-71.2353558!16s%2Fg%2F11bw40z4v4?entry=ttu) at Richard McGrath Park (the same location as the BUDA leagues play) on Sunday afternoons from 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Feel free to email me before you go to see if I will be playing that day.
