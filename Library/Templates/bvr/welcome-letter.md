# Welcome to the [[date|%Y]] [[team_name]] Season!

I would like to introduce myself as the head coach of the [[team_name]]. This is my [[hc_year]] year as head coach, and my [[hc_years_coaching]] year coaching at Beaver. {--say something brief about your background. Coaching/playing--}

Our assistant coach(es) is [[ac_name]]. {--say something brief about assistant coach(es)--}

We are so excited for this season. {--Mention some goals, etc...--}

I want to highlight some important items about the season below.

## Schedule

It is important to check the athletic schedule daily. Weather and other issues come up that lead to last minute changes. You can get [our athletic schedule online](https://athletics.bcdschool.org/teams-schedules/ultimate-frisbee), and add the team calendar to your google calendars. In addition, students and guardians will be notified of any schedule changes with as much notice as possible.

## Attendance

Attendance at every practice and game is mandatory. There are acceptable reasons for missing a practice or game, such as medical and family emergencies and illness or injury.

Please schedule outside appointments on weekends or vacations so we can benefit from a full team at practice. Parents/caregivers must give advance notice if a conflict arises by emailing me ([[hc_email]]) and attendance ([[attendance_email]]).

## Playing Time

Please note that at the varsity level, we cannot guarantee playing time. While we strive to get everyone as much playing time as possible, sometimes this is not doable.

At the JV/3rds level, everyone will play, but playing time may not be equal.

As coaches, we will set aside time to frequently meet with each individual player, and we are happy to meet with any player at any time, outside of games or practices, to discuss any issues or concerns they have.

As part of our policy, we do not discuss playing time with parents before, during, or immediately after games.

## Contact Information

My email is: [[hc_email]]. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you all for your support in making this season a successful one!

See you all soon. Go Beaver!

Sincerely,
[[hc_name]]
