Hey There,

You’re getting this email because you signed up for Ultimate Frisbee in the spring. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Coach Nelson, the varsity head coach.

As we start the winter term, I wanted to touch base about how to prepare for the upcoming season, which will be here before you know it!

**The ultimate frisbee season ramps up quickly in the upper school, so it is important that you do some form of physical activity during the winter term.**

While we are just starting to work on the schedule, the game can start as soon as April 1st. That means we will have a week of “pre-season/tryouts” the first week of March, followed by two weeks of spring break and then a week before the season begins.

This schedule can be challenging because it means there is less time to get in shape. That is why it is so important that you do something over the winter. If you are playing a winter sport, that is great, and I won’t ask you to do anything extra for frisbee.

**If you are not playing a winter sport, I strongly suggest enrolling in the Beaver Strength and Conditioning program with coach [[trainer_name]].** It takes place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays afternoons and she will prepare frisbee-specific exercises to help you prepare for the season.

**If you have signed up for the strength and conditioning program or will sign up, please respond to this email and let me know.** By the end of the week, I’d like to send her the names of participating frisbee players.

**If you cannot participate in the Strength and Conditioning program, please try to do something else, such as running.**

To be clear, I’m not expecting everyone to start the season at full fitness, but it will be a lot harder if you do nothing all winter, which could potentially cause injury problems during the season.

I’m really looking forward to this upcoming season, and I hope you are too!
