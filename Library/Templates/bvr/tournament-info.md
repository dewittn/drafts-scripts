## Attendance

**This is a reminder that tournaments are part of the regular season, and everyone is expected to attend.** If someone cannot make the tournament, I need to know ASAP. Please do not surprise us on the day of by being a no-show.

## Location

The tournament is taking place at Northfield Mount Hermon in Gill, MA. A map of the fields can be found on the [2025 NEPSUL D1 Open Championships website](https://scorereport.net/2025/youth-open/event22550).

## Travel

**Players should arrive at Beaver on Saturday between 6 a.m. and 6:20 a.m. The team bus will leave as close to 6:30 a.m. as possible.** Gill, MA, is roughly a 2-hour drive, and we want to be there in time for the captain’s meeting at 8:30 a.m. and with enough time to warm up before our first game.

I know that getting to Beaver this early may be challenging, so those players who live farther away could arrange to stay at another player’s house.

With our last game starting at 2:00 p.m., **I expect we should return to Beaver around 6 p.m.** That time depends on traffic and whether we stop to get food.

Players can travel independently from the team if needed, but it’s easier if everyone takes the team bus.

## Schedule

**We will play four games to 13, with a time limit of 75 minutes.** There will be approximately 25 minutes between games to rest and recover. Due to the weather, these times may be shortened to 65-minute games with 15-minute breaks, so we aren’t playing in a thunderstorm.

- 09:00 am: Field 5 vs Choate Rosemary Hall Varsity
- 10:40 am: TBD
- 12:20 pm: TBD
- 02:00 pm: TBD

## Food

**The tournament organizers will NOT provide food**, so we will have to bring food ourselves. Thank you to Loan and Kristen for organizing the snacks. Please check [their spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15WsUSz1XzfndkeXkolU9d-7QhKdvVUEdJ3lhC336btA/edit?gid=682423558#gid=682423558) to see what people are bringing.

Since our games will be played back-to-back, there won’t be time to eat lunch. **I recommend eating small snacks or sandwiches throughout the day.** After the tournament, the team can go out for a meal or order food. 

I am still working with Beaver to see what food the school will cover. Most likely, this will be breakfast items such as bagels and bananas.

Generally speaking, good tournament food consists of carbohydrates and some salt. It should also be food that isn’t too heavy and that can be eaten between games. 

**A reminder that Beaver is a nut-free school, so please avoid food with peanuts or almonds.** If we bring sandwiches, they must consist of cold cuts.

Food that's good:
- Gatorade
- Bagels
- Banana
- Oranges
- Pretzels 
- Pickles
- Bread
- Cold cuts
