Constantly reminded she doesn\u2019t belong, Rakhi lives alone in a Mumbai slum, working as a lowly office assistant at Justice For All, a struggling human-rights law organization headed by the renowned lawyer who gave her a fresh start.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Fiercely intelligent and in possession of a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue, Rakhi is nobody\u2019s fool, even if she is underestimated by everyone around her. Rakhi\u2019s life isn\u2019t much, but she\u2019s managing. That is, until Rubina Mansoor, a fading former Bollywood starlet, tries to edge her way back into the spotlight by becoming a celebrity ambassador for Justice For All. Steering the organization into uncharted territories, she demands an internship for Alex, a young family friend from Canada and Harvard-bound graduate student. Ambitious, persistent, and na\u00efve, Alex persuades Rakhi to show him \u201cthe real\u201d India. In exchange, he\u2019ll do something to further Rakhi\u2019s dreams in a transaction that seems harmless, at first.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As old guilt and new aspirations collide, everything Rakhi once knew to be true is set ablaze. And as the stakes mount, she will come face-to-face with the difficult choices and moral compromises that people make in order to survive, no matter the cost. Reema Patel\u2019s transportive debut novel offers a moving, smart, and arrestingly clever look at the cost of ambition and power in reclaiming one\u2019s story.\n  </p>\n </span>\n</div>\n",
